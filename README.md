<p align="center">Supply Chain Sustainability Reporting</p>

The demand for transparent sustainable development from investors and customers has grown over the years.

Investors now place increased emphasis on a business's sustainability when evaluating its value and resilience.

Consequently, more organizations are investing resources in building capabilities for sustainability reporting and determining optimal strategies for sustainable supply chains.

## **Article**
In this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/supply-chain-sustainability-reporting-with-python-161c1f63f267), we introduce a simple methodology for **reporting CO2 emissions from your Distribution Network** using **Python and PowerBI**.

## **Definition**
Based on the GHG Protocol corporate standard (Link), greenhouse gas emissions are classified into three scopes:

- Scope 1: Direct emissions released into the atmosphere due to the companyâ€™s activities (e.g., company facilities like manufacturing plants/warehouses, company vehicles).
- Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy (e.g., purchased electricity, gas).
- Scope 3: All other indirect emissions occurring in the company's value chain (e.g., transportation, waste operations, business travel).

This article focuses on Scope 3 calculations related to downstream transportation.
What is the environmental impact of your distribution network?

## **Formula**
Following the protocol of the French Environmental Agency Ademe (Link), the formula for estimating transportation CO2 emissions is:

<p align="center">
  <img align="center" src="images/equation.png" width=75%>
</p>
<p align="center">Formula using Emission Factor</p>

<p align="center">
  where,
  E_CO2: emissions in kilograms of CO2 equivalent (kgCO2eq)
  W_goods: weight of the goods (ton)
  D: distance from your warehouse to the final destination (km)
  F_mode: emissions factor for each transportation mode (kgCO2eq/t.km)
</p>

This formula provides a gross estimation of CO2 emissions without requiring granular transportation data.
A more accurate approach would be to estimate CO2 emissions for each delivery, considering the vehicle model (e.g., truck, container carrier, plane, or train) and filling rate.

## **Objective**

1. Collect and process data to calculate emissions based on this formula.

3. Add distances by mode and compute CO2 emissions per order.
